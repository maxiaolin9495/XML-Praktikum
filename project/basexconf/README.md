# BaseX Configuration

- The file in this folder represents a basic .basex, which needs to be placed in the BaseX program folder (e.g. "C:\Program Files (x86)\BaseX" or "/opt/basex").
- ``[path_to_basex]`` needs to be replaced with the absolute path to the BaseX program folder (e.g "C:\Program Files (x86)\BaseX" or "/opt/basex")
- ``[path_to_repo]`` needs to be replaced with the absolute path to this repo (e.g. "C:/Documents/repos/xmlpraktikum" or "/home/``[username]``/Dokumente/repos/xmlpraktikum" where ``[username]`` is the name of your account) after copying the file.
